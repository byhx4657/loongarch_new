2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks cpu_clk_clk_pll and cpu_clk_clk_pll_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware.

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks cpu_clk_clk_pll_1 and cpu_clk_clk_pll are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks cpu_clk_clk_pll_1] -to [get_clocks cpu_clk_clk_pll]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#3 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks timer_clk_clk_pll and timer_clk_clk_pll_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks timer_clk_clk_pll] -to [get_clocks timer_clk_clk_pll_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#4 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks timer_clk_clk_pll_1 and timer_clk_clk_pll are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks timer_clk_clk_pll_1] -to [get_clocks timer_clk_clk_pll]
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#1 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at cpu/EXE_state_inst/u_alu/signed_mul_result of size 16x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#2 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at cpu/EXE_state_inst/u_alu/signed_mul_result__0 of size 16x16, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#3 Warning

Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#4 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at cpu/EXE_state_inst/u_alu/signed_mul_result__2 of size 18x16, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#1 Warning
False path, asynchronous clock group or max delay datapath only constraint between synchronous clocks  
A False Path timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks cpu_clk_clk_pll and timer_clk_clk_pll (see constraint position 5 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). Masking entire synchronous clock domains via  set_false_path, set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only may result in failure in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#2 Warning
False path, asynchronous clock group or max delay datapath only constraint between synchronous clocks  
A False Path timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks cpu_clk_clk_pll_1 and timer_clk_clk_pll_1 (see constraint position 5 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). Masking entire synchronous clock domains via  set_false_path, set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only may result in failure in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#3 Warning
False path, asynchronous clock group or max delay datapath only constraint between synchronous clocks  
A False Path timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks timer_clk_clk_pll and cpu_clk_clk_pll (see constraint position 4 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). Masking entire synchronous clock domains via  set_false_path, set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only may result in failure in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#4 Warning
False path, asynchronous clock group or max delay datapath only constraint between synchronous clocks  
A False Path timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks timer_clk_clk_pll_1 and cpu_clk_clk_pll_1 (see constraint position 4 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). Masking entire synchronous clock domains via  set_false_path, set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only may result in failure in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin pll.clk_pll/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_clk_pll, clkfbout_clk_pll_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin pll.clk_pll/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: cpu_clk_clk_pll, cpu_clk_clk_pll_1

TIMING-56#3 Warning
